    image is relatively high), it is possible to use the converter function

    parameters will be respectively the width and height of the generated

    Now it's time to show ASCII art on the screen. First, we set drawing
    parametrs. Next, we call the function typeArray2d() embedded in the
    ASCII Art library, that writes the contents of a two-dimensional array
    containing (implicitly) text characters (chars) on the screen. In this
    case, we call a function with 2 parameters: the first is the table
    whose contents we want to print, and the second is the destination (an
    object with "canvas" property). If you use the function with two
    parameters (as we do in this example), it will assume that you need to
    fill the entire surface of the target canvass with a drawing. However,
    the function can be called in 3 variants:
      [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst);
      [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst, _x, _y);
      [AsciiArt instance].typeArray2d(_arr2d, _dst, _x, _y, _w, _h);
    The parameters are as follows:
      _arr2d - 2-dimentional array containing glyphs (chars)
      _dst - destination (typically the sketch itself)
      _x, _y - coordinates of the upper left corner
      _w, _h - width and height
    It is relatively easy to write your own function that formats the contents
    of an array to ASCII graphics. At the end of this example, I glue the
    function code from a non-minimized version of the library - it can be
    used as a base for your own experiments.
